# VAN-GAN: Vessel Segmentation Generative Adversarial Network

## Introduction
Innovations in imaging hardware have led to a revolution in our ability to visualise vascular networks in 3D at high resolution. The segmentation of microvascular networks from these 3D image volumes and interpretation of their meaning in the context of physiological and pathological processes unfortunately remains a time consuming and error-prone task. Deep learning has the potential to solve this problem, but current supervised analysis frameworks require human-annotated ground truth labels. To overcome these limitations, we present an unsupervised image-to-image translation deep learning model called the ***Vessel Segmentation Generative Adversarial Network (VAN-GAN)***. VAN-GAN integrates synthetic blood vessel networks that closely resemble real-life anatomy into its training process and learns to replicate the underlying physics of an imaging system in order to learn how to segment vasculature from 3D biomedical images. By leveraging synthetic data to reduce the reliance on manual labelling, VAN-GAN lower the barriers to entry for high-quality blood vessel segmentation to benefit imaging studies of vascular structure and function.

## Methodology
This Python package utilises image-to-image translation to segment 3D biomedical image volumes of vascular networks. Our unsupervised deep learning framework builds upon [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) in several ways:
* Extend the design to 3D for image volume generation using 3D convolutions.
* Utilise a deep residual U-Net architecture for generators.
* Apply random Gaussian noise to discriminator inputs and convolution layers for improved training stability and regularisation.
* Use a modified objective loss function:
  * Introduce a structure similarity reconstruction loss between real and cycled biomedical image volumes.
  * Introduce a [spatial and topological constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07311) between real and cycled segmentation labels.
  * Exclude identity loss.

## Installation
To install the package from source, download the latest release on the VAN-GAN repository or run the following in a terminal window:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/psweens/VAN-GAN.git
```

Please ensure that cudatoolkit, cudnn and Tensorflow are correctly installed as per their installation instructions [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

Tensorflow and the remaining Python packages below can be installed in a [_conda_](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) environment.

The remaining required Python packages can be install using _pip_ in a terminal window:
```bash
pip install opencv-python scikit-image tqdm tensorflow_addons tensorflow-mri joblib matplotlib
```

VAN-GAN has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS with Python 3.9.16 and the following package versions:
* Cuda 11.2.2
* Cudnn 8.1.0.77
* [Tensorflow 2.10.1](https://www.tensorflow.org)
* Opencv-python 4.7.0.72
* Scikit-image 0.20.0
* [tqdm 4.65.0](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
* [Tensorflow-addons 0.20.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons)
* [Tensorflow-mri 0.22.0](https://github.com/mrphys/tensorflow-mri)
* Joblib 1.2.0
* Matplotlib 3.7.1

## Example Dataset
A paired synthetic 3D image dataset composed of segmentation labels of mathematical-derived 3D vascular networks and corresponding simulated photocoustic images can be found here. This dataset can be used to performed unsupervised training of VAN-GAN and then validate segmentation predictions using the known ground truth labels.

## Code Contributors
VAN-GAN code was originally developed by [Paul W. Sweeney](www.psweeney.co.uk) who continues to actively develop the framework. VAN-GAN is an open-source tool and so would benefit from suggestions and edits by all and so community development and involvement is welcomed.
